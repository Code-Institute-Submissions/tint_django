LANDING

ABOUT TEXT

Type It Now is an audio and video transcription service. We do academic, medical,
and legal transcription. The transcripts we produce are manually typed by experienced
transcriptionists and are at least 99% accurate â€“ transcripts are delivered in Microsoft
Word documents.



The formatting used for every transcript is very clean, clear and professional. At the
beginning of each transcript, there is a portion for the file details, i.e., title, length of
audio, number
of speakers, and audio quality. For two-speaker audio files, the speakers are denoted as
interviewer/interviewee or speaker 1/speaker 2. For audio files with more than two speakers, the
interviewer is denoted with bold and italic font and the interviewee is denoted with standard
font. If you would like a more specific format,
let us
know and send in a template when placing the order.
